OfficeConvert is a tool that allows you to use Microsoft Office for 
converting legacy formats as well as external formats to automatically
export to OpenDocument Format and PDF.

There are two builds, one for Microsoft Office 2007 and one for Office 2010.
Version 1.3.1 contains additional code by Dirk Vollmar, and allows to 
use the import and export capabilities of the ODF addin 
(http://odf-converter.sourceforge.net/.)
